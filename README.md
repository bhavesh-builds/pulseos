# PulseOS

PulseOS consolidates key updates from multiple apps into categorized "pulses," so users don't need to open each individual app to stay informed.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project built with React Native for iOS.

## Features

- **Categorized Updates**: View updates organized by Social, Finance, Work, and Personal categories
- **Social Integration**: Connect Facebook and Instagram accounts to see consolidated social updates
- **Unified Dashboard**: One place to see all your important updates

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
